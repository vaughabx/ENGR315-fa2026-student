"""
This problem requires you to calculate compounding interest and final value of a  US treasury deposit based upon
current interest rates (that will be provided). Your analysis should return the final value of the investment
after a 10-year and 20-year period. The final values should be stored in the variables "ten_year_final"
and "twenty_year_final", respectively. Perform all your calculations in this file. Do not perform the calculations by hand
and simply write in the final result.

Prompt: On October 27th, 2022, Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44B in total, with reportedly $33B of his own money. Since
that time, it appears this investment has not worked out. If Elon has instead bought $44B of US Treasury Bonds, how much
would his investment be worth in 10-year and 20-year bonds? Assume the 10-year bonds pay 3.96%,
the 20-year bonds pay 4.32%, with each compounding annually.
Note that Elon's capital will be $33B.

## Coumpounding Interest Formula: A = P(1 + r)^(t) ##
## P = Principal Amount (initial investment) ##
## r = Interest Rate (as a decimal), 10yr-.0396, 20yr-.0432 ##
## t = Time (in years) ##

## define variables and perform equation ##
def ten_year_final_value():
    return 33_000_000_000 * (1 + .0396) ** 10

def twenty_year_final_value():
    return 33_000_000_000 * (1 + .0432) ** 20
